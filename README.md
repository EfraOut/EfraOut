# Who am I?

## Summary

Before thinking of myself as a Software Engineer, I like to see myself as a constant work in progress. I am very passionate about learning anything in general. During my time in college, I took introduction classes in Physics, Chemistry, Humanities, Microeconomics, Hebrew, and American Sign Language.
What I really like about being a Software Engineer is the capacity to be involved in all learning environments. My goal is to make a difference and help through technology to make a better world for everyone!

## Hobbies
- Crochet: I started learning a year ago, and I love it. I also met my wife through it ;)
- Piano: Started when I was 16, and I just play casually. Currently learning to play the organ. Wish me luck!
- Board Games/Video Games: I love connecting with people while having some fun! Sometimes I can be chaotic, so be careful!

## Why me?
There are many talented people out there, especially in this industry. The unique talent that I can present is learning. With two spoken languages and one sign language, I have learned how to learn. I can recognize patterns, find ways in difficult situations, and appreciate people's cultures and thoughts. With me, you are bringing a new culture to your environment.

## Projects
### Hackatons
* My contribution to the team was the creation of the code used for the Arduino Uno components used on a puzzle box. [Check out the code!](https://github.com/EfraOut/PuzzleBox)
* Created an AI-powered quiz generator through OpenAI's API. The topic is generated through speech recognition. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/EfraOut/QuizAI)

### Other
* As a capstone, we created as a classroom an SSD of a program that would interact with BYU-Idaho's enroll system to generate the schedules for students based on their preferences. The document can be viewed [here](https://github.com/EfraOut/EfraOut/blob/main/EnrollEase.pdf)
